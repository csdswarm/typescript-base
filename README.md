# typescript-base
A barebones typescript skeleton for a new typescript project

To create locally use:

```bash
npx degit csdswarm/typescript-base app-name
cd app-name
npm i
```

Where app-name is the name of the app you are trying to create.

Modify package.json, tsconfig.json, tslint.json and rollup.config.js to match the requirements of your app environment.

Additionally, modify .gitignore to ignore your specific IDE files, etc.
